*Once upon a time, there was a-* wait! This isn’t a Disney movie*. Well,* Shit -

I guess all great stories start this way. Most importantly now that the intro is out of the way let me introduce myself: *the Arbitrary Author:* aka Benjamin Sklivas and welcome to this site. I hope that you guys stay for a while. We will be talking over a range of topics including but not limited to: *mindfulness, meditation, finding meaning in life*, and honestly, just giving you the honest and complete story of who the fuck I am along the journey.

NO barriers. NO moderation. Just the untouched and unfiltered truth. 

So turn on, tune in, or drop out because this will be an experience.

For those of you who are wondering where I have been? I took some much needed "me" time, figuring who or what I am supposed to be doing moving forward in life. The creative drive has come back to me and, I will push forward, and keep writing, so bear with me. 

### **The Disclosure of 2020**

A little disclosure, this post **WILL BE** full of grammatical errors, rants, emotional irregularity and overall inconsistency. An intro that represents what it means to be: **THE ARBITRARY AUTHOR.**

If you thought this little introduction of who I am is all rainbows and sunshine, well, think again. This is about to get personal, and it is going to get real and will make you feel all sorts of discomfort. In all honesty, I might lose a lot of friends after you read this. But honesty and transparency are the aim of this post; not friendship.  

Because let’s be honest here. I am the type of person to answer the: *“How you doing?”* question with revelation insight into my actual life. RATHER than just say traditional *“fine”* or *“good”.*

Let’s just normalize being content with not being okay. Right? Can I get an **AMEN!!!?**

The year was 2020. God, even just saying it gives me **PTSD**. Anyways! I started working for **Mind Geek**. Specifically, **Traffic Junky**. You know *“the exclusive advertising partners for Pornhub and its subsidiary partners”*  The number of times I’ve said that. It should be considered an art form.

Where were we again? Oh yes, pardon my ADHD mind for a minute. I was just starting work at Trafficjunky, getting into that corporate life, which **I SO DESPERATELY “NEEDED”.**  In hindsight, the corporate was not the best idea of mine in the first place (Hindsight always 20/20). Throughout the year and a half I was there, I won "best salesman", I gave back, started initiatives, and then….all of a sudden!!!!

A BIG FAT *“YOU’RE FIRED”* Zoom call. Featuring a noteworthy mental breakdown (Note this is mental breakdown #1). Honestly, I probably would not have found my way out of it if it was not for my girlfriend at the time. Let’s call her hum…**Snow White** for her discretion.

But throughout the past year, was I expecting to meet anyone who would make it into my social life? HA! No… but, in all seriousness. I met Max, and that was the start of an amazing relationship! Which by the end of the summer led to road trips with Snow White, Max, and Margaux! 

Getting back to the narrative, I got fired, I lost everything, and I mean everything. So thank God for Snow White and the amazing support she gave me throughout the time where I was the shell of a man I used to be. 

### **WARNING: TURBULENT TIMES AHEAD. Hope you brought a life vest.** 

Fast forward to about a month or so before the shit **HIT THE FAN**. I mean, in all honesty, it was completely my fault. So I am taking full responsibility for the following:

I *broke down* after losing my job, and I felt the *walls falling* around me like I was on some horrifying psychedelic bad-trip. *I lost everything:* *I lost my job,* *my freedom*, *my motivation to work, my confidence in myself*, and most of *all, I lost the most important thing* to me, **Snow White.** 

I mean, I fucked up my relationship… I have had issues my whole life about consistently needing a source of *external validation* to tell me that I'm good enough, I'm better, I'm worthy, attractive, the list goes on. Some of the need must come from my ADHD, and maybe it comes from past trauma. I don’t have a full understanding of it yet, but I'm dealing with it and I’m starting to implement the strategies that my therapist and I have come up with!

So plain and simple: *I CHEATED*. I lost sight of the most important person. I was no longer me anymore. The blame is on me, the posts about how shitty I am and how her friends send her gift packages because I CHEATED, that’s all on me. I expect the *“Hope the next girl he dates has a therapist on speed dial”, so when it comes, ill be ready!*

I lost the most important person in my life. How do I feel about it? I mean, crying happens, **WAY** more than I would like to admit. Sleepless nights? Check that off the list too. The worst part, *EVERYTHING IN MY HOUSE REMINDS ME OF HER!! So if you really want to know, it sucks.*

So, if anyone has a little package for me, that would be cool. K, Thanks.

In all honesty, again, let me write it. This is all my fault and I respect Snow White for leaving, and I know that I have issues and I was a shitty fucking boyfriend. There is a lot work ahead. Learning to love and accept myself before I can even think of her or any women.

It’s a time to reflect on what we take for granted, see what we neglect in relationship and how we can fight back on the laziness that seeps into it. What are your thoughts on building constructive and fruitful relationships with partners, with friends and with all those around you?

I think that you have had enough of me ranting for one post. But let me assure you that the story has yet to get serious. I have so much more to say! Part 2 is on its way!

With that being said, SEE **YOU**, SPACE **COWBOYS**..
